        "Hank Mulligan spent 17 years growing potatoes in Idaho until, in his words, he had “a vision from the starch gods.” The next morning he launched PotatoBrain AI, a startup claiming to “bring cognitive intelligence to root vegetables.” Q: How did you build the AI model? Mulligan: “I scanned 4,000 potatoes with my iPhone. Then I yelled ‘learn!’ at the laptop for three hours. Eventually it stopped crashing. That’s when I knew it was becoming conscious.” PotatoBrain AI’s flagship product, TuberNet, promises to predict a potato’s future “life choices,” including emotional resilience during boiling. Despite revealing that no one at the company knows what a neural network is, PotatoBrain recently raised $72M. Mulligan: “They said my energy felt very ‘technical.’ I was wearing glasses that day.”",
